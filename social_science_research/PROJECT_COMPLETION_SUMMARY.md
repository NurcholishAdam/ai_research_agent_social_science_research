    quality_metrics = self._generate_quality_metrics(query, contextual_result)
    
    # Simulate expert feedback
    expert_feedback = self._simulate_expert_feedback(query, contextual_result, quality_metrics)
    
    # Calculate reward scores
    reward_scores = self._calculate_reward_scores(expert_feedback, quality_metrics)
    
    # Generate improvement recommendations
    improvement_recommendations = self._generate_improvement_recommendations(reward_scores, expert_feedback)
```

### Semantic Graph Processing
```python
def _apply_semantic_graph_processing(self, query, limit_graph_result):
    # Build semantic relationships
    semantic_relationships = self._build_semantic_relationships(query.theoretical_framework, limit_graph_result["entities"])
    
    # Integrate with knowledge base
    knowledge_integration = self._integrate_with_knowledge_base(semantic_relationships, query.methodology)
    
    # Generate semantic insights
    semantic_insights = self._generate_semantic_insights(knowledge_integration, query.cultural_context)
```

### Contextual Engineering
